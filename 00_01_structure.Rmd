# Structure of this Handbook

The handbook presents a number of  case studies, judiciously chosen to cover a broad spectrum of possible solutions. 
Case studies are chosen from known access mechanisms around the world, with a focus on providing lessons applicable to the North American context.

The summary section provides a broad synthesis of the case studies, using the same structure (outlined below), and 
condenses the case studies into recommendations, best practices, and explicit guidance. 
Each thematic section is introduced, the specific challenges unique to the section sketched out, and the choice of case studies explained.
