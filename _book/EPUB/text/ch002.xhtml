<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)</a></strong> is a global research center working to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is informed by scientific evidence. Anchored by a network of more than 225 affiliated professors at universities around the world, J-PAL draws on results from randomized impact evaluations to answer critical questions in the fight against poverty. Many of the randomized evaluations conducted by J-PAL affiliated professors have used administrative data. J-PAL builds partnerships with governments, NGOs, donors, and others to share this knowledge, scale up effective programs, and advance evidence-informed decision-making. Many of these partnerships have also helped make administrative data available for research. J-PAL was launched at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2003 and has regional centers in Africa, Europe, Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, the Middle East &amp; North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. In 2019, J-PAL launched the Innovations in Data and Experiments for Action Initiative (IDEA) to improve access to and use of administrative data for evidence-based policymaking.</p>
