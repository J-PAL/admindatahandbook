## Versioning {-}

As an online-first publication, we adopt the following versioning policy:

- The Handbook follows a variant of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules. A version is identified by a numeric version number in the format "`vX.Y.Z`" (Major.Minor.Patch).
- As new chapters are added or existing chapters modified or removed, new versions of the Handbook are released. 
  - Minor edits and corrections are identified internally with a `patch` number (e.g., `v1.0.1`) but not identified in the publicly available version. 
  - Additions of case studies and chapters necessarily lead to an increment in the `minor` number (e.g., `v1.1`). However, such additions can be added in batches. 
  - Whenever a chapter is removed, a new `major` version is released (e.g., `v2.0.0`).
  - When the curators estimate that a sufficiently large number of additions warrant highlighting through a new `major` number, such a `major` version may also be released.
- Much of the development of the Handbook occurs openly. To make clear that a particular online version of the Handbook is not officially published, development versions have a `-dev`  sufffix, e.g., `v1.2.0-dev` if leading up to a proposed `v1.2.0` release. 
  - Nearly completed versions that are being reviewed will have a `-rc[n]` suffix (e.g., `v1.2.0-rc1`), where `rc` stands for "release candidate."

Only major versions are printed. Minor versions are made available in ebook formats. Patch versions may be made available in ebook formats.
