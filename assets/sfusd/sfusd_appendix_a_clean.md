**AGREEMENT FOR CONFIDENTIAL DATA EXCHANGE BETWEEN**

**SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT** **AND**

**STANFORD UNIVERSITY**

This Data Exchange and Warehousing Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between San Francisco Unified School District (hereinafter referred to as "SFUSD" or "District") and the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University ("Stanford University") (collectively the "Parties") and is dated for convenience June 17, 2020.

WHEREAS, SFUSD desires to provide information and data to Stanford University for the purposes storing and releasing the data for research studies approved by SFUSD;

WHEREAS, this Agreement sets forth the means to be used by Stanford University to ensure the confidentiality and security of SFUSD information and data.

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

**A. [THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT]{.ul}**

The Family Education Rights Privacy Act ("FERPA") permits the release of personally identifiable student data without prior written parental consent if the release is to "organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests, administering student aid programs, and improving instruction, if such studies are conducted in such a manner as will not permit the personal identification of students and their parents by persons other than representatives of such organizations and such information will be destroyed when no longer needed for the purpose for which it is conducted" 20 USC 1232g(b)(1)(F). Each party agrees to comply with FERPA, and other applicable laws, in its performance of this Agreement.

**B. PURPOSE**

SFUSD and Stanford University agree that SFUSD will provide Stanford University with confidential data pursuant to FERPA section 1232g(b)(1)(F), for the purpose of research as described in this Agreement ("Data"). The list of such Data is specified in Attachment A to this Agreement, and may be modified in writing by mutual consent of the Parties from time to time during the term of this Agreement. Stanford University will store the Data on the District's behalf in a secure (that is, a system or computer using current industry standard technology to protect against unauthorized access including encryption software), password-protected computer, server or other electronic device at Stanford University's Center for Education Policy Analysis ("CEPA"). CEPA will share specific Data elements only with approved users under a data use agreement signed by SFUSD ("SFUSD Approved Study") for one of the following purposes:

1.0. For use solely by Stanford University researcher(s) in a SFUSD Approved Study under the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement.

1.2. Where researchers of Stanford University and a third party(ies) are collaborating together in a SFUSD Approved Study under the terms and conditions of a data use agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

CEPA will provide the approved data to a Stanford University researcher and/or their third party collaborators only once the data use agreement has been approved by SFUSD officials, and CEPA has received written permission (via email or other means) from SFUSD to give the data to Stanford University researcher or researchers based on the signed data use agreement.

1.3. Under a SFUSD Approved Study performed by a third party under a data use agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit C to this Agreement.

Data provided by SFUSD for the purposes of this Agreement will include only the data legally permissible to provide to outside agencies for the purposes of research.

**C. SCOPE**

Part 1: Cooperation in Providing the Data

1.01 SFUSD agrees to provide CEPA with downloads of data that is legally permissible to share with a research institution. These downloads happen within approximately the first two months of each semester of each school year of this Agreement.

1.02 CEPA agrees to provide back to SFUSD extracts of District data when requested by District administrators in the Research, Planning, and Assessment office. CEPA agrees to provide this data according to the same protocols outlined for data exchange in this Agreement.

1.03 SFUSD and Stanford University will make sure that all appropriate data is transferred and stored pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. CEPA data manager/s will maintain a spreadsheet tracking the exchange of SFUSD data between SFUSD and CEPA, and will make such spreadsheet available to District RPA administrators upon request.

Part 2: Agreement to Provide Data for Research Projects

2.01 Upon receipt of an Approved Study from SFUSD, CEPA will transfer data under said SFUSD Approved Study to the Approved Study organization(s). SFUSD will provide instructions to CEPA for the transfer of data under the SFUSD Approved Study. Such instructions shall include the specific items of data to be transferred, the method of transfer, and the address or location where the data is to be transferred.

Part 3: Protection and Security of Personal Information

3.01 CEPA will use appropriate and reasonable efforts to store all SFUSD data on a password-protected, encrypted storage system connected to a desktop computer in a locked office. Back-up copies of the data (on encrypted storage mediums) will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked office. Only CEPA's Faculty Director, data manager, and approved Stanford/GSE IT staff will have access to the SFUSD data set stored at CEPA.

3.02 CEPA will transfer data to each SFUSD Approved Study through a secure-FTP (file transfer protocol) server or other secure file transfer systems approved by SFUSD. Identification numbers included in the data from SFUSD will be de-identified by CEPA before being shared with any organization having a SFUSD Approved Study, unless approval has been granted by SFUSD to share unscrambled identification numbers and such approval is reflected in the data use agreement with the organization with a SFUSD Approved Study.

3.03 CEPA will maintain a spreadsheet tracking the exchange of data between CEPA and other organization with a SFUSD Approved Study, and make such spreadsheet available to District RPA administrators upon request.

Part 4: Benefits to School and/or District

4.01 SFUSD has a limited amount of resources and wants to make sure it has a productive partnership with Stanford University. Therefore, SFUSD wants to expand its capacity to fulfill data requests of a SFUSD Approved Study in a timely manner.

Part 5: Timeline

5.01 CEPA agrees to transfer Data to a SFUSD Approved Study within 30 days of Stanford University's receipt of a written approval and instructions from SFUSD. CEPA will not transfer any Data that has not been specifically approved in writing by SFUSD to be transferred. This timeline does not include additional requests for Data made by a SFUSD Approved Study after the initial Data has been transferred. SFUSD will make every effort to meet this timeline, however, during periods of peak workload, some delays may occur.

**D. NATURE OF DATA**

The specific Data to be transferred to Stanford University under this Agreement are listed in Attachment A ("Specific Records on Data Elements") which shall be incorporated into this Agreement by reference as though fully set forth herein.

**E. TRANSFER OF DATA**

SFUSD and Stanford University shall use a secure, mutually agreed upon means and schedule for transferring confidential information. At no time will SFUSD or Stanford University send data electronically in an unsecured format to or from the Parties. The Parties agree that the Data may be electronically transferred via the Stanford-SFUSD Google Suite shared drive accessible to authorized users secure log-in only.

First, the data will be transferred from SFUSD to Stanford University. Stanford University's Graduate School of Education has agreed to Securely store the data at CEPA, under the leadership of the CEPA Faculty Director and Executive Director.

Second, CEPA will devote personnel to manage the incoming data, make sure the data are in a readable format with guidance from SFUSD, organize the data, and work with SFUSD to understand the data elements. This includes maintaining a codebook (i.e., detailed documentation -- source, date, and definition) of all the data from SFUSD.

Third, any Stanford Research Organization/Stanford Researcher that would like to conduct research with SFUSD data must complete and submit a proposed data use agreement to the District's Office of Research, Planning and Assessment. SFUSD will assess the proposed data use agreement, and if such agreement is approved, will assess what data elements are appropriate to be shared with the Stanford Research Organization/Stanford Researcher for the purpose of the project outlined in the data use agreement.

Fourth, for approved data use agreements, Stanford University personnel will contact the CEPA data manager to request a secure transfer of data elements outlined in the approved and fully executed data use agreement to the Stanford Research Organization/Stanford Researcher, and provide the CEPA data manager with a written request (via email or another means) to supply the approved data to the Stanford Research Organization/Stanford Researcher. The CEPA data manager will also request documentation of Stanford IRB approval for the Stanford Researcher Organization/Stanford Researchers project, in accordance with Stanford IRB, including the list of the approved variables in the IRB documentation.

Fifth, the CEPA data manager will securely transfer these data to the SFUSD Approved Study within 30 days of receipt of the written request from SFUSD.

Sixth, once data is transferred via the Stanford-SFUSD Google Suite shared drive to Stanford Research Organization/Stanford Researcher, the CEPA data manager will delete SFUSD data from the Google Suite shared drive after receipt by the project and/or by the end of 14 days.

Seventh, Stanford Research Organization/Stanford Researcher access to the Google Suite shared drive will expire at the end of every academic year (July 1) and will need to be changed or renewed if additional data is being requested in the following academic year.
