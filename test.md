# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} 

# Evolution of the Handbook and Contributing {-}

The Handbook is intended to dynamically evolve over time. Releases are called "versions", starting with `V1`. Because many of the aspects that influence data sharing evolve over time, and because the initial set of case studies cannot cover the full breadth of administrative data sharing, future contributions and updates are envisioned.
