#### Data Access Types

| Control of: | Data access | Analysis computers | Access computers | Access rooms | Analysis methods |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| FSRDC researcher | Full | Full | Full | Full (badge access) | Some (choice of software) |
| Census employee | Full | Full | None (VDI) | None (VDI) | Some (choice of software) |
| IAB: RDC researcher | Full | Full | Full | Full (trusted person) | Some (choice of software) |
| IAB: JoSuA researcher | Full | Full | None (Web application) | None (Web application) | Smaller (software, whitelist commands) |
| IAB employee | Full | Full | Full (IAB laptop) | None (VDI) | Some (choice of software) |

#### Remote Execution
- Technical overview
  - Data is stored remotely, researcher never has direct access to data
  - Researcher gets synthetic data and codebook to write analysis code
  - Researcher submits analysis code to data provider which vets and runs the code (this may require back and forth)
  - Data provider sends output back to researcher
  - Pros: most secure for data, researcher never sees data
  - Cons: requires dedicated staff to run analysis code, time consuming for researcher, expensive in staff time for agency
- Requirements
  - Space and Equipment
    - Possible that no extra dedicated space and equipment beyond what data provider already has for its own work
    - Requires some means for transfering synthetic data, analysis code, and outputs
  - Staff
    - Requires staff at agency to do the remote execution, needs to have technical expertise to run the code and work with researcher
  - Cost
    - Staff time = ???
- Examples
	  - CDC RDC (sort of, they create an analysis file for you but execution of analysis is done by researcher at RDC https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/leftbrch/Presubmit.htm)
	  - Statistics Canada https://data.library.ubc.ca/gen/Synthetic.html


#### Physical Data Enclave
- Technical Overview
  - Data can be stored either on site or remotely on a server with access through clients
  - Researcher travels to physical enclave to have controlled access to data
  - Researcher can only remove output from physical enclave
  - Pros: researchers have access to data in controlled environment
  - Cons: researchers have to travel, high resource requirements
- Requirements
  - Space and Equipment
    - Access controlled room
    - Client computers and servers
    - Software
  - Staff
    - FSRDCs are led by a director and have several dedicated administrative staff
    - Safepod model would need remote technical support
  - Cost
    - NSF grant for \$100,000 to \$300,000 in startup costs (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15586/nsf15586.htm), three grants all awarded \$300,000
    - NIH estimates "millions" (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-085.html)
    - Â£25,000 to build a safepod https://thetab.com/uk/stand/2015/03/31/mysterious-library-safepods-13641
- Data enclave examples
  - FSRDC at universities
  - NORC at Chicago
  - Safepod (new model)
	

#### Virtual data Enclave
- Technical Overview
  - Data is stored on a server with remote access available to researchers.
  - Remote access can be through either a physical thin client or through a remote desktop
  - Thin client or virtual desktop configured to only allow researcher to remove output from remote server
  - Pros: researcher does not need to travel to physical data enclave, enabling faster research
  - Cons: cost of providing thin client, endpoint securit requirements with remote desktop, physical security of researcher location
- Requirements
  - Space and Equipment
    - Central server to house data
    - Thin client or virtual desktop software cost
  - Staff
    - Need staff to audit the researcher to ensure they are complying with requirements when working remotely
  - Cost
    - staff time???
    - thin clients ???
    - Virtual desktops???
- Examples
  - College Board - Lily Fesler?
  - SFUSD laptop - Lindsay Fox?
  - Statistics Denmark - log into virtual machine to access data on central server

#### Data transfer to researcher

- Technical Overview
  - Some mechanism of transferring the data to researcher for storage
  - Range of requirements from asking researcher to set up own secure data room e.g. mini-RDC to letting researchers store it locally on their own work computers
  - Requires high amount of trust between researcher and data provider
  - Possibly send data to third party for remote cleaning/matching
  - Pros: highly flexible for researcher, hypothetically minimizes costs for data provider
  - Cons: maximizes liability and risk for both researcher and data provider
- Requirements
  - Space and Equipment
    - Data transfer mechanism (FTP, cloud system, expiring links, encrypted device)
    - Data storage for researcher (cloud, local server, data room)
  - Staff
    - Staff at data provider need to extract data and provide to researcher
    - Someone needs to do data cleaning and matching, either at researcher, data provider, or third party
  - Cost
    - highly variable depending on the setup
- Examples
  - SFUSD warehouse
  - NCES Restricted Use Data License
  - California Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development (OSHPD)
  - CARES Data
  - Charlotte-Mecklenburg Public Schools

#### Notes

What are you referring to with secure laptops, biometrics, cloud computing?


The base for the chapter I'm proposing - on the physical 
elements of a "safe environment" - is in this presentation: 
https://github.com/larsvilhuber/BigThinkPresentations/tree/master/PhysicalProtections. 
We would want to expand it a bit (maybe update it), but essentially a catalog 
(with maybe a multi-dimensional characteristics vector - complexity - cost - security).

Presentation - aimed at management level people at statistical agencies, 
not the highest level of tech background. Needs some translation into text, 
should be picture heavy. Presentation compiled two years ago, needs to be updated. 
Other technological setups can be integrated into this. Describe various secure endpoint/server setups.

We should also consider the network architecture as one component of the technical infrastructure. Can range from sneaker net (sending encrypted CDs), public internet with secure connection (Windows RDP), software-based VPN, hardware-based VPN, dedicated network hardware (routers, etc.), dedicated secure networks (at a local level: this might mean a secure server room and a on-premise secure lab, but might also mean: a nation-wide secure government data network). One example for the latter (national secure data network) is the Canadian CANARIE network.https://www.canarie.ca/network/

We describe the current technology as used by various systems that provide access to 
sensitive data (creating "Safe Settings"), and avenues for future access. We adress

- Secure laptops
- Remote access
- Cloud computing
- Secure rooms
- Biometrics
