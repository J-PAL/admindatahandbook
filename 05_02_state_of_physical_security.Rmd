## Physically Protecting Sensitive Data

History of access mechanisms to admin data
- US
- France
- Germany

Overview of 5 safes framework
- Focus on safe settings

Physical Access Spectrum
- Complexity/Cost vs. Security

#### Types of data access (listing pros and cons of each)

|                      | USA | France | Germany | Canada |
|----------------------|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| Physical enclave     | Yes | No     | Yes/ No | Yes    |
| Data in same enclave | No  | --     | No      | Yes    |
| Custom hardware      | No  | Yes    | No      | No     |

#### Data Access Types

| Control of: | Data access | Analysis computers | Access computers | Access rooms | Analysis methods |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| FSRDC researcher | Full | Full | Full | Full (badge access) | Some (choice of software) |
| Census employee | Full | Full | None (VDI) | None (VDI) | Some (choice of software) |
| IAB: RDC researcher | Full | Full | Full | Full (trusted person) | Some (choice of software) |
| IAB: JoSuA researcher | Full | Full | None (Web application) | None (Web application) | Smaller (software, whitelist commands) |
| IAB employee | Full | Full | Full (IAB laptop) | None (VDI) | Some (choice of software) |
| CASD researcher | Full | Full | Extra Full (custom-built hardware) | Some (university office, EU) | Some (choice of software) |

#### Remote Execution
  - Researcher submits code to agency
	- Research tests code on synthetic data data
	- Costly for 
	- Security and logistical issues (have to pass code and output back and forth)
	- Examples


#### Physical Data Enclave
  - Research Data Centers (researcher goes to RDC)
    - Researcher travels to RDC or enclave
    - Data enclave examples
      - FSRDC at universities
      - NORC at Chicago
      - New model - Safepod
	- Cost of RDC
	  - NSF grant for \$100,000 to \$300,000 in startup costs (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15586/nsf15586.htm)
	  - NIH estimates "millions" (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-085.html)
	  - FSRDCs are led by a director and have dedicated administrative staff
	- Safepod
	  -  £25,000 to build one https://thetab.com/uk/stand/2015/03/31/mysterious-library-safepods-13641
	- Space and staffing requirements
	- Pros (most secure form) and cons (most inconvenient for everyone, most expensive)


#### Virtual data Enclave
  - Thin client
    - Secondary secure PC giving a view onto a secure data environment
    - Expense of giving hardware to researcher
    - Easier and more flexible for researcher than physical access, but more security risks
    - Examples? - SFUSD gave a laptop to Lindsay Fox for a project, College Board does this as well
	- Remote desktop
	  - Software downloaded onto researcher PC giving access to secure data environment
	  - Relies on researcher to have hardware
	  - More endpoint security considerations
	  - Examples?

#### Data transfer to researcher
    - FTP, expiring links, cloud systems, physical transfer (encrypted USB, CD, etc)
		- Data provider loses control over data
		- Most convenient, least secure
		- Cost, staffing, logistics, security considerations
		- Examples (e.g. SFUSD)

#### Notes

What are you referring to with secure laptops, biometrics, cloud computing?


The base for the chapter I'm proposing - on the physical 
elements of a "safe environment" - is in this presentation: 
https://github.com/larsvilhuber/BigThinkPresentations/tree/master/PhysicalProtections. 
We would want to expand it a bit (maybe update it), but essentially a catalog 
(with maybe a multi-dimensional characteristics vector - complexity - cost - security).

Presentation - aimed at management level people at statistical agencies, 
not the highest level of tech background. Needs some translation into text, 
should be picture heavy. Presentation compiled two years ago, needs to be updated. 
Other technological setups can be integrated into this. Describe various secure endpoint/server setups.

We describe the current technology as used by various systems that provide access to 
sensitive data (creating "Safe Settings"), and avenues for future access. We adress

- Secure laptops
- Remote access
- Cloud computing
- Secure rooms
- Biometrics
