## Physically Protecting Sensitive Data

### Intro of typical access mechanisms

#### Remote Execution
#### Physical Data Enclave
#### Virtual Data Enclave
#### Data Transfer to Researcher

### Five Metrics of Physical Security
#### Data Location

At data provider, at researcher, at third party
Third-party: At researcher institution (secure data service), At third-party institution 

#### Analysis Computers

at data location, by researcher: Full or partial (partial means a limited set of programming languages or other)

#### Access Computers

At data provider, at researcher, at third party 

#### Access Rooms

Open: no security, access from anywhere
Low security: defined but otherwise open location (IP control)
Medium security: controlled access to room (controlled by third party, controlled by data provider)
High security: strong specification of security (safe walls, video monitoring, limited access)

#### Analysis Methods

Any method (subject to software availability), or limited analysis (tabulation, but limited language set - reduced/whitelisted SAS or Stata)

### Technical features, infrastructure, implementations
#### Thin Clients
#### Biometrics
#### Secure Rooms
#### Etc

### Examples from the handbook along the five metrics
#### SFUSD-Stanford
#### New Brunswick
