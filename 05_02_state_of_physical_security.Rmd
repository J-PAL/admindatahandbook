## Physically Protecting Sensitive Data

The base for the chapter I'm proposing - on the physical elements of a "safe environment" - is in this presentation: https://github.com/larsvilhuber/BigThinkPresentations/tree/master/PhysicalProtections. We would want to expand it a bit (maybe update it), but essentially a catalog (with maybe a multi-dimensional characteristics vector - complexity - cost - security).

Presentation - aimed at management level people at statistical agencies, not the highest level of tech background. Needs some translation into text, should be picture heavy. Presentation compiled two years ago, needs to be updated. Other technological setups can be integrated into this. Describe various secure endpoint/server setups.


History of access mechanisms to admin data
- US
- France
- Germany

Overview of 5 safes framework
- Focus on safe settings

Physical Access Spectrum
- Compelxity/Cost vs. Security

Types for data access
- Physical access only
- Remote access
- Data transfer to researcher

Physical access
- Research Data centers (researcher goes to RDC)
- Remote execution (researcher submits code to agency)

Remote access
- Thin client (Secondary secure PC giving a view onto secure data environment, with manual DA)
- Remote desktop (Software on your own PC giving a view onto secure data environment, with manual DA)

Data transfer
- FTP, expiring links, cloud systems
- Physical transfer (encrypted USB, CD, etc)
