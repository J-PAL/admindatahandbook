# DOI Numbering and Archiving

## Items and Numbering 

DOI are registered for the following items. All numbers are preceded by the (PREFIX), e.g, `10.12345`. (VERSION) is assigned according to our versioning scheme, e.g., `v1.0` or `v2.1`. (SHORT) is the abbreviation of the chapter, typically included in the URL, e.g., `discavoid.html`.

| Item | Numbering |
|------|-----------|
| HTML version of the whole handbook | adminhandbook.(VERSION)                   |
| HTML pages of each chapter         | adminhandbook.(VERSION).(SHORT)           |
| PDF of the whole book              | adminhandbook.(VERSION).pdf               |

| Ebook  (Kindle version)            | adminhandbook.(VERSION).mobi              |

## Archiving

We will use the [J-PAL community at DSpace@MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/39118), in a special collection for the Handbook.

| Item | Numbering |
|------|-----------|
| HTML version of the whole handbook | ZIP file of entire handbook               |
| HTML pages of each chapter         | Single HTML file                          |
| PDF of the whole book              | PDF                                       |
| PDF of individual chapters (if produced) | PDF                                 |
| Ebook  (Kindle version)            | Mobi file                                 |
| Ebook  (EPUB version)              | EPUB file                                 |

In each case, the DOI will be pointed at the Handle (e.g., `1721.1/xxxx`), and the DOI recorded as an "Other identifier".
