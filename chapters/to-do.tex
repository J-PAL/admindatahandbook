INDEX:
- is it standard to have first letter not capitalized? It looks fine to me, but wondering what's the norm. If so:
- "Physical access cards", "Program targeting", "Secure rooms", "Synthetic data", "Thin clients" etc. are "half" capitalized (not complete)
- Can we have a ; separating index entry from page numbers ( to distinguish 45 CFR 46; [pages])?
- "DIME's" in the index
