There are at least two parties to such agreements: the data provider and the data requestor. The +data_provider| is responsible for permitting data access on behalf of the collecting agency or data subjects. The data provider is bound by law, regulation, or policies that may be very specific regarding access to direct identifiers (name, date of birth, social security number) and sensitive information (health conditions, grades, or test scores). The +data requestor| is a researcher pursuing data access for a specific purpose. Researchers at universities must typically go through a review of the DUA by an Office of Research or Sponsored Programs or the Office of the General Counsel and possibly by university information security specialists.
