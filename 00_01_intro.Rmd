# Introduction
In order to provide guidance to current and future researchers, data providers, and administrators wishing to make data more broadly available, we have endeavored to collect a broad and diverse collection of experiences from those who have undertaken such endeavors in the past. There are excellent starting points on many topics: the various challenges of making data available securely  (see e.g. @Reuter2010-xr, @Harron2017-qp,  @ADRF_Network2018-wl,  @Future_of_Privacy_Forum2017-kj ); resources on data held by national statistical offices (NSO) and the initial creation of integrated data systems, including (in the U.S.) work by [Actionable Intelligence for Social Policy (AISP)](https://www.aisp.upenn.edu/); the general "Five Safes" framework [@DesaiFiveSafesdesigning2016]; and guides for the European context, which include case studies ( @OECDEXPERTGROUPINTERNATIONAL2014 , @Bujnowska2019-eq). 

However, in our many conversations with researchers and sub-national (potential) data providers, we have found a desire to not just see a distillation of best practices, or the experiences of national statistical agencies, but to also see “the raw data” - the myriad of decisions for and against certain choices to be made, the context of when certain practices have been found to be useful, and where other choices might, in retrospect, be made differently.

The handbook presents a number of case studies on "research data access scenarios." Each scenario represents an attempt, mostly successful, of making confidential or proprietary data accessible to a "broad" set of researchers. The definition of "broad" is necessarily vague: it excludes cases where one part of, say, a government has made available data to another part of the government. It typically includes access by researchers who are not primarily associated with the institution creating, collecting, or making accessible the data in question, and who typically are associated with a university, though non-profits or journalists might also be a user type. In general, there will continue to be some access restrictions - we explicitly exclude scenarios that are primarily "open data" scenarios, where data have been successfully anonymized and posted for anybody to use. Nevertheless, some scenarios may be motivated by open data laws or regulations, or may have a open data publication component. It may involve the exchange of money between the data provider and the researcher, whether for profit or for cost recovery. 


We provided our contributors with a [template], which can be considered like a self-guided interview, asking them to respond to a variety of topics. Not all topics were relevant, important, or even considered by each contributor, and readers will see this reflected in each of the contributions. We aimed to find out foundational considerations - why even think about making the data available - to the most mundane but ultimately pressing needs - who will pay for it? How much does that computer infrastructure cost? Intrigued readers can use the [template] to self-evaluate, or use it as a planning tool for their own implementation.
