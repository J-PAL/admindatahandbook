## Template

> *Instructions:* Use this template to structure your contribution. Delete this line when you are done. We have drawn in part of generic guidelines provided by @OECDEXPERTGROUPINTERNATIONAL2014 and @DesaiFiveSafesdesigning2016 . 

### Motivation
> *Instructions:* Describe WHY you are making data available. Whereas the next section will discuss your legal ability to provide access to the data, this section is meant to allow you to describe the motivation of your entity (business, company, government) to provide access to data that otherwise would not be available. What are the outcomes that benefit you, or the performance metrics that matter to you?

### Legal context

#### Access

> *Instructions:* (privacy, mandate, ability to contract, Data use agreements, License). Describe in what context you are allowed to, able to, mandated to provide access to the data. Are you, as the data custodian, also the unit able to define the data use agreements, or are you an intermediary, providing access to data as authorized by other entities? What kind of sanctions can you impose (financial, reputational, penal)? Have you ever imposed them? 

#### Intellectual property

> *Instructions:* Do you assert Intellectual Property (IP) on the original data? On any derivative data created by researchers with access to the data? On any derivative product (research papers, tables) created by academic researchers? On source code/programs created by researchers (typically when processing data within your IT boundaries)? Do you require co-authorship on researcher output? How do you enforce IP? Is there a review process (also see "[Safe Outputs]")? Do you consider the results of the statistical analysis to be "open data" by default, or subject to copyright? What license are researchers granted on the results they generate? Do you require that researchers seek your approval before publication - for reasons other than statistical disclosure avoidance - for instance, to verify how content or statements interact with corporate or government policy?

### Five Safes framework

The "Five Safes framework" [@DesaiFiveSafesdesigning2016] provides structure to many aspects of providing secure access to data:

- Safe projects - evaluating applications for appropriateness
- Safe people     - establishing trust in researchers
- Safe settings - how can the data be accessed?
- Safe data - how sensitive is the data/ can the data be made
- Safe outputs - how sensitive are the results/tabulations/etc. 

> *Instructions:* For each dimension, describe how important each element was in the final implementation, and how expensive it was in the overall scheme to implement. Cost can be measured in monetary units or in time-units (person-months), as necessary. Please provide  a numerical criterion (from 1 - least important to 5 - most important) for both importance and cost. Also provide a verbose description on how you went about implementing it - what you tools or systems you chose for the implementation.

#### Safe projects 

> *Instructions:* evaluating applications for appropriateness. Do you have a formal application process, or an ad-hoc/informal application process? Do you have publicly posted rules, or do you consider applications on a case-by-case basis? Do you use IT systems to manage the flow of applications, or an informal workflow? Who is involved with assessing each project's merits - lawyers, statisticians, data scientists, domain experts? How long does the typical approval process take (min/avg/median/max)? Is that information publicly posted? How costly (time/money) is the approval process? 

#### Safe people

> *Instructions:* How do you go about establishing trust in researchers?  Do you use a "circle of trust model" [@OECDEXPERTGROUPINTERNATIONAL2014]? If yes, describe it. Do you have special requirements - training, citizenship, professional standing, background security checks by police or specialized services? Do you accept credentials from other institutions? How often do you verify such criteria? Do you trust researchers for access procedures, for disclosure avoidance procedures, for data handling? Do you inspect every such access, disclosure, data handling procedure, or only some? If you require training, who conducts the training, and how often? How much do these procedures cost (time, money)?

####  Safe settings 

> *Instructions:* how can the data be accessed? Do users download the data to an arbitrary computer, to a secure computer? Are users provided with a secure computer (laptop or other remote access devices)? Do users remotely access the data via remote submission, or via secure remote interactive access (sometimes called a virtual data enclave)? Do you have off-site access points (in satelite offices, or in collaborating institutions)? Do you require users to travel to physical locations? Do you use multiple access settings? Are the various safe settings only used for researchers, or are they also used internally? How much do the various settings cost you? Provide specifics (software, hardware) of how you instantiate these settings. If providing IT resources to researchers, what statistical software (SAS, Stata, Python, R, Spark, etc.) do you provide researchers? How do you handle researcher-provided software or code? Why did you choose specific implementations? 

#### Safe data 

> *Instructions:* how sensitive is the data/ can the data be made? Do you differentiate various risk levels for datasets (low/medium/high-risk)? How do you map these various levels to the "circle of trust"? To various safe settings? How much maintenance does it require to create researcher-accessible datasets? Are they a normal part of your data processing pipeline, or are they created explicitly for researchers? On-demand, or on a schedule? Who does the transformation, if any? How much does this part cost? 

#### Safe outputs 

> *Instructions:* how sensitive are the results/tabulations/etc. Do you verify the results yourselves?  Do you verify all outputs, or sample? Do you incorporate safe-output rules into your user agreements? Who is involved with verification of safe outputs - lawyers, statisticians, data scientists, domain experts? Do you provide users with tools to check that their outputs meet your rules? How long does the typical approval process take (min/avg/median/max)? How costly is the enforcement?

### Revenue

> *Instructions:* Please discuss revenue sources to fund the data access project. Do you charge user fees, or fees to data providers? How are fees charged or itemized - per project, per user, per location, per access, per time unit, per data unit, etc.? Do fees cover your costs? Are fees posted publicly, or are they negotiated on a case-by-case basis? Do you receive operating funds for the data access project from other sources? 

### Metadata

> *Instructions:* Best practices [@OECDEXPERTGROUPINTERNATIONAL2014] suggest to publish statistical and functional metadata on the data resources in an open way. Describe what metadata you have published, how you generated the metadata, who is involved in the creation and maintenance of metadata. Was generating such metadata integrated into your normal business processes, or was it added on as a result of the data access project? Is it integrated now? What standards do you use (JSON, XML, DDI, SDMX, etc.)? Are they machine-readable and (where applicable) translated into English? 

### Data Life-cycle and Replicability

#### Preservation of Researcher-accessible Files

> *Instructions:* Are researcher files preserved? If yes, over what time period (5, 10 years, forever)? Is there active curation, or only preservation of current bitstreams? Do you perform the archival/curation functions yourself, is another entity within your organization responsible for this activity, or is a third-party (national, regional, university archive) responsible for this? Do you generate persistent identifiers for these?

#### Reproducibility of Researcher-accessible Files

> *Instructions:* Can researcher-accessible files be consistently regenerated, or are they snapshots of a dynamic database or data pipeline? Are the query mechanism reproducible/archived (can similar files be recreated), or are they manual queries?

#### Preservation of Researcher-generated Files

> *Instructions:* Researchers may generate intermediate and final data files and tables. Researchers generate processing code/programs. Are these preserved? If yes, for what time? Can other researchers access these files, with or without the permission of the original researchers (and subject to [Safe projects], [Safe settings], and [Safe people] conditions)?  Do you generate persistent identifiers for any of these?


### Metrics

> *Instructions:* How do you measure the success of your data access project? Number of people, number of datasets provided, number of papers, number of citations, number of mentions? Provide some sample statistics.
